h1. NHGRI-BW2 modules/scripts

p. This software is intended to automate many of the tasks associated with running
bioinformatic analyses on the NIH biowulf2 cluster using input data residing on a
separate server.  It provides methods for transferring data, creating sbatch and
swarm scripts and submitting them with appropriate options, monitoring job status
and checking job outcome, and transferring output files and logs back to the user's
own server from biowulf2.

p. NHGRI-BW2 was written by Nancy Fisher Hansen, a staff scientist in the Cancer
Genetics and Comparative Genomics Branch (CGCG) of NHGRI, an institute at the 
National Institutes of Health.  Nancy can be reached at nhansen@mail.nih.gov.
